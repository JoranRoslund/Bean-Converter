Usage:

python beanConverter.py \<NODENAME\> [\<SITE\>]

\<SITE\> can be LN or LI. LN is assumed if skipped.

or

python beanConverter2.py [\<NODENAME1\> \<NODENAME2\> ...]

If issued without nodename list, it is assumed to be in the bean
directory of a node, and tries to deduce nodename and site.

To download, create a new directory. run 'git init' on it
and run 'git clone https://github.com/JoranRoslund/Bean-Converter.git'.
